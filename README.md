# Data Pipeline and Reporting Automation

## Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end data pipeline using Apache Airflow, dbt (Data Build Tool), and Redash for automated data loading, transformation, documentation, and reporting. The pipeline involves segregating environments (Prod, Dev, Staging), ensuring data quality, and enabling reporting through dashboards.

## Technology Stack

- **Apache Airflow:** Orchestration tool for managing workflows.
- **dbt (Data Build Tool):** For data transformation and documentation.
- **Redash:** Reporting tool for creating dashboards and visualizations.
- **Git:** Version control system for managing queries and codebase.
