# Data Pipeline and Reporting Automation

## Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end data pipeline using Apache Airflow, dbt (Data Build Tool), and Redash for automated data loading, transformation, documentation, and reporting. The pipeline involves segregating environments (Prod, Dev, Staging), ensuring data quality, and enabling reporting through dashboards.

## Technology Stack

- **Apache Airflow:** Orchestration tool for managing workflows.
- **dbt (Data Build Tool):** For data transformation and documentation.
- **Redash:** Reporting tool for creating dashboards and visualizations.
- **Git:** Version control system for managing queries and codebase.

## Implementation

### Airflow DAGs

- Utilized Bash/Python operators in Airflow to load data files into respective database environments (Prod, Dev, Staging).
- Managed metadata and variables within DAGs using Airflow's templating and context capabilities for dynamic workflows.
- Implemented automated alerting via Slack/Email in case of DAG failures to notify stakeholders promptly.

### dbt Integration

- Connected dbt with the Data Warehouse (DWH) for data transformation.
- Created transformation codes using dbt's capabilities, enabling execution via Bash/Python operators in Airflow.
- Automated the generation of dbt documentation and exposed it via a web frontend for easy access and reference.
- Explored dbt macros to create dynamic documentation and functions, enhancing flexibility in the data transformation process.

### Quality Monitoring and Pipeline Integrity

- Implemented additional modules of dbt (e.g., great_expectations, dbt_expectations, re-data) to ensure data quality and integrity.
- Built hard circuit breaker pipelines in dbt to prevent updating production tables in case of test failures, maintaining data reliability.

### Reporting Environment

- Connected the reporting environment and created dashboards using Redash, showcasing the transformed data.
- Established a version control system using Git, where Redash queries and codebase are stored, enabling easy management and tracking of changes.

## Important Decisions and Considerations

- **Separation of Environments:** Strategically segregated environments (Prod, Dev, Staging) to manage data pipeline workflows efficiently and safely.
- **Automated Alerting:** Implemented automated alerts to notify stakeholders promptly in case of DAG failures, ensuring quick resolution.
- **Data Quality Monitoring:** Leveraged dbt and additional modules for rigorous data quality checks and pipeline integrity.
- **Version Control for Queries:** Established a version control system using Git to manage Redash queries and codebase effectively.
